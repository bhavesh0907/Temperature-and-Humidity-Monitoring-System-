# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

This Arduino-based system monitors **temperature** and **humidity** using a **DHT11 sensor** and an **I2C LCD**. It automatically controls relays for **heating, cooling, humidification, and dehumidification** based on user-defined thresholds. Ideal for **incubators, greenhouses, and smart home automation**.

## Components Required
- **Arduino Uno/Nano**
- **DHT11 Sensor**
- **16x2 I2C LCD Display**
- **Relays (x4)**
- **Push Buttons (x3)**
- **Power Supply**

## Features
✅ Real-time Temperature & Humidity Display  
✅ User-defined Threshold Settings  
✅ Automatic Relay Control for Climate Adjustment  

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/temperature-humidity-monitor.git
   cd temperature-humidity-monitor
